# beansoup-wsn
Beansoup is a framework which allows to build and mantain an high-scalable, secure, reliable/fault tolerant wireless sensor network

Bensoup provides network, transport and routing protocols for security-aware, reliable sensor network. Our goal is to provide auto-organization for sensor nodes with high fault-tolerance and dynamic data forwarding. The routing protocol provides tools for network-level based authentication. The network and transport protocol are fully QoS-aware, providing various traffic-profiles for real time, best effort or guaranteed delivery. All network architecture was implemented in a C library for embedded systems
 with low and high level APIs and routing software
